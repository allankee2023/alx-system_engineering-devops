# What I learned from this project  
At the end of this project you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:  
---  

Fix a broken web server, the first instance of this series. More notes on the bottom.

The Webstack debugging series will train you to the art of debugging. Computers and software rarely work the way we want (that’s the “fun” part of the job!).

Being able to debug a webstack is essential for a Full-Stack Software Engineer, and it takes practice to be a master it.

In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state. But before writing this Bash script, you should figure out what is going on and fix it manually.

Let’s start with a very simple example. My server must:

have a copy of the /etc/passwd file in /tmp
have a file named /tmp/isworking containing the string OK
Let’s pretend that without these 2 elements, my web application cannot work.

Let’s go through this example and fix the server.
